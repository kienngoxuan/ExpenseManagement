This is my first project that I really want to complete in the first week of 2025.
I want to track my daily expenses without running the program.

Ideas:

For security: 
  User input required: username and password.
  I designed this program to include a database for storing user information.
  (It will query the database to search for login information; if the password is correct, the user will be able to log in; otherwise, access will be denied.)
  (If the username does not appear in the database, the program will prompt the user to sign up.)
  The program will ask for the initial amount of money (only once for new users).
  
Getting money in or out (in/out) (+/-):
  Entering money (after +/-)
  Entering category (create a category if it doesn't exist)
  Has a timestamp for when something is input

For UX/UI and visualization:
  Receive money: +
  Spend money: -
  Includes a line chart that is automatically updated to help visualize the daily summary of money.

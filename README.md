This is my first project that I really want to complete in the first week of 2025.
I want to track my daily expenses without running the program, using a user-friendly UX/UI and frontend.

Ideas:

	For security:

		- User input required: username and password.
		- I designed this program to include a database for storing user information.
		- (The program will query the database to search for login information. If the password is correct, the user will be able to log in; otherwise, access will be denied.)
		- (If the username does not appear in the database, the program will prompt the user to sign up.)
		- The program will ask for the initial amount of money (only once for new users).

	Getting money in or out (+/-):

		- Entering money (after entering +/-)
		- Entering a category (choosing the correct category for the transaction)
		- A timestamp will be recorded for each transaction.

	For UX/UI and visualization:

		- Receive money: +
		- Spend money: -
		- Includes a line chart that is automatically updated to help visualize the daily summary of expenses and income.
		- Includes a pie chart to show the five most significant types of income or expenses.
